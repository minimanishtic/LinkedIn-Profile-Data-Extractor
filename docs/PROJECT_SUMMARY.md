# Project Summary: LinkedIn to Zoho Recruit Integration

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build an automated system to extract LinkedIn profile data from screenshots and create candidates in Zoho Recruit, bypassing expensive third-party tools like Make.com.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Tempo Labs (no-code platform)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express on Vercel
- **APIs:** Google Vision (OCR), Claude AI (parsing), Zoho Recruit (CRM)

## Current Status

**95% complete** - everything works except automatic token refresh

## What Works ‚úÖ

- **File Upload:** Multipart form upload from frontend to backend
- **OCR Extraction:** Google Vision API successfully extracts text (4000+ characters)
- **AI Parsing:** Claude accurately parses profile details into structured JSON
- **Zoho Integration:** Creates candidates successfully when valid access token exists
- **Manual Token Refresh:** Using Postman to refresh tokens works perfectly

## The Challenge üö´

**Long-term Operation:** The app needs to run for months without manual intervention, but:

- Access tokens expire after 1 hour
- Automatic token refresh returns "No access token received"
- Manual refresh via Postman works, but automatic refresh fails

## Solutions Attempted

### ‚ùå Failed Attempts:

1. **Initial Implementation:** Sent refresh request as JSON instead of form-encoded
   - Error: 500 Internal Server Error with HTML response
   - Fix: Changed to URLSearchParams and form-encoded content type

2. **Missing Functions:** getUserCredentials and createCandidate were missing
   - Fix: Removed unnecessary calls and added missing methods

3. **Class vs Module:** Code was importing class as module
   - Fix: Changed to instantiate class properly

### ‚úÖ Successful Fixes:

- Converted refresh request from JSON to form-encoded format
- Properly instantiated ZohoService class
- Added token management to handle missing access tokens

## Current Issue

The refresh token request appears successful (returns 200 status) but:

- Response contains no access_token field
- Might be returning HTML error page instead of JSON
- Same credentials work perfectly in Postman

### Symptoms:

1. Request returns 200 status (appears successful)
2. Response.data exists but has no access_token field
3. Might be HTML instead of JSON (not confirmed)
4. Same refresh_token works in Postman

### Postman Success:

- **Method:** POST
- **URL:** https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2/token
- **Body:** x-www-form-urlencoded with same parameters
- **Returns:** Valid JSON with access_token

## Environment Variables

**Confirmed set:**

- `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN`: 1000.509534c4d7f1b2e...
- `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`: 1000.ZS23YFTDD5MXZ07...
- `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`: ebc3f242e2a1880bfd84...

## Key Question

Why would the same refresh token work in Postman but return no access_token in the Node.js/Axios request? What differences between Postman and Axios could cause this?

## Areas to Investigate

1. Potential differences in how Postman vs Axios send requests
2. Hidden headers or settings Postman might be adding
3. Zoho-specific requirements that might be missing
4. Debugging steps to see the actual response content

## API Endpoint

https://accounts.zoho.in/oauth/v2/token
